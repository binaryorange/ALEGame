# ALEGame

Welcome, if you've stumbled upon this then you have found the source code to my upcoming "ALEGame"! 

I know what you're thinking, "What kind of a name is that?", and I'll tell you right now that it's a codename, of course.
"Well that makes sense", you say in your mind, "but why don't you have this repo as private?".

"Money", I respond casually, as I look upon my bills and expenses and decide that someday soon I will pay for the plan to privatize certain repos, but for now I don't particularly care as all of this code is bound to change at some point and also, I'm not particularly popular and I highly doubt someone will steal my source code.

Also, I stole this source code from many examples across the web, so it's already out there, and makes no difference to me if it gets used or not. Now when I start making assets and models and my own media for the game, that's when I'll start caring about things getting "stolen". 

For now, enjoy this loony README.md, and my insanity as I code this project together in such a way that someday, I might be able to profit off of the final product.
